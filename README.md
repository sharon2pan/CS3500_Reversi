This is a project that I worked on with a partner for CS3500 Object Oriented Design at Northeastern University.

The purpose of this code is to successfully create an online version of the game Reversi (or Othello), but with a hexagonal board instead of the standard square board. 
The program takes in user input through keyboard and mouse events in order to execute moves. A working AI player with multiple strategies is also implemented in the code, 
meaning that the user is able to play against the computer.

More detailed version about the code is located in the README file in the src folder!
