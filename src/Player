1. make IPlayer interface
    -> make PlayerImpl class that implements IPlayer
        • public class PlayerImpl implements IPlayer

    methods
    • play(ReversiModel model) //allows the user to make a move based on the strategy they
                                  decide to pursue
    • pass(ReversiModel model) //allows the user to pass their turn
    • getCell(); //the color assigned to the player

2. make IStrategy interface --> for choosing where to play next for the given Player
    --> make classes that implements IStrategy for diff strategies the Player can use
        • public class PromptUser //asks the user where they want to play next
        • public class PlayNextToFirstLegalOppositeColor //plays the first Cell that is
                                                           a Cell of the opposite color
             --> PlayCenter method //plays the center
             ^ make it a smaller detail that's part of a bigger class somehow
        --> differentiate between Human Player and AI
            (make some methods only the Human Player can access vs AI)

    methods
    • choosePos(ReversiModel model, Cell player);
